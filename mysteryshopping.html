		<P><h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2></p>
		
      <p>First, we recruit Advance Best mystery shoppers from our network of 400,000 members across America. These mystery shoppers are certified and trained to observe and report on various aspects of the client's business, such as customer service, product quality, and employee behavior.

Once the assignment is assigned to the mystery shopper, they visit the client's establishment undercover, posing as a regular customer. During their visit, they carefully observe and take note of their experience, paying attention to every detail.

Afterward, the mystery shopper submits a detailed report, providing feedback and insights about their visit. This report is then reviewed, analyzed, and compiled into a comprehensive evaluation that is shared with the client.

Finally, the client can use this valuable information to identify areas of improvement and enhance their overall customer experience. Mystery shopping is a fascinating process that helps businesses gain valuable insights into their operations and provides them with a unique opportunity to enhance their services.
